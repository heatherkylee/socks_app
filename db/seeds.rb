# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# sock = Sock.new(color: "white", size: 10, department: "mens", pattern: false)
# sock.save

# sock = Sock.new(color: "blue", size: 7, department: "womens", pattern: true)
# sock.save

# sock = Sock.new(color: "pink", size: 3, department: "kids", pattern: true)
# sock.save
